      <ol>
        <li>
          Identify the three major types of nodes found in an HTML document that
          we work with in JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          Why is the JavaScript textContent property safer than innerHTML?
        </li>
        <li>
          Every HTML element you write as a developer becomes a corresponding
          DOM object. And remember -- an object is just a fancy storage
          container. An object contains two things: properties and methods. And
          each property of the document object may contain a single value or it
          could contain another object! For example body is a property of the
          document object. And what does body contain? Another object of
          properties and methods. So you might write a statement such as this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Why do we rarely, if ever use document.write() ? (Hint: I have a
          stand-alone youtube on this subject for details,
        </li>
        <li>What is a JavaScript method? Define and provide two examples.</li>
        <li>What is a JavaScript property? Define and provide two examples.</li>
        <li>
          We have been working with three "built-in" objects that are already
          provided for us when we use JavaScript for its initial purpose -- to
          modify HTML and CSS in response to user interaction on the web page.
          Provide a sample method for each of these three objects: window,
          document, and console.
        </li>
        <li>What is a CSS selector? Define and provide two examples.</li>
        <li>What is a CSS property? Define and provide two examples.</li>
        <li>What is a CSS declaration? Define and provide two examples.</li>
      </ol>
