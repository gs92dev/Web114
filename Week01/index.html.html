      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What is the purpose of JavaScript? Answer in general and also provide
          three specific examples of how JavaScript is commonly used.<br />
          JavaScript was first created with the purpose of making web pages
          interactive on the user side. Nowadays, JavaScript is used for a
          inumerous purposes, such as: Validate forms, create animations, create
          interactive maps, can be used on the server side, modify webpages,
          among others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who invented JavaScript and when?<br />
          Answer: JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 and it was
          developed for Netscape.
        </li>
        <li>
          What software program will you be using to write JavaScript?<br />
          VS Code
        </li>

        <li>
          What software program will you be using to run JavaScript?<br />
          Chrome
        </li>
        <li>
          Why are external scripts preferable to scripts added directly within
          an HTML file?<br />
          External scripts are preferable because they can be more easily
          maintained, they can be cached "(Other pages that reference the same
          script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the
          file is actually downloaded only once. That reduces traffic and makes
          pages faster."
          <a href="https://javascript.info/hello-world">javascript.info</a> ),
          and they can be reused in multiple pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          And after you complete the exercises below, answer these questions
          too..
          <ul>
            <li>
              What's the point of all of those consule.log() statements?<br />
              The log is a way for us, developer to debug and log what we want
              to see on the console, the only way to see the logs is opening the
              inspector and looking at it.
            </li>
            <li>
              What's the difference between how you reference a variable versus
              a string in a JavaScript statement? <br />
              To reference a variable we just need to call its name without
              quotes, either double or single, and to reference a string we need
              to put it between quotes.
            </li>
            <li>
              What's the difference between a single value and an expression in
              a JavaScript statement? <br />
              A single value is a value is only a piece of data, like a number,
              a string, or a boolean, and an expression is a piece of code that
              returns a value, like a variable, a function, or a combination of
              values and operators.

    <script>
      //   "use strict"; // 3.  In the script created in step 1 and also step 4, include the "use strict": directive as the first line.
      //   // 1. Add a script that alerts "Hi World!"
      //   alert("Hi World!");
      //   // 2. In the script created in step 1, add a statement to console.log("Hi Insert Your Name");
      //   console.log("Hi Guilherme");
      //
    </script>
    //
    <script>
      //   "use strict"; // 3.  In the script created in step 1 and also step 4, include the "use strict": directive as the first line.
      //   // 4. Add a second script that declares 2 variables:
      //   const myName = "Guilherme";
      //   let mySalary = 80000;
      //   console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my salary is " + mySalary);
      //   // 5. In the script you created in step 4, but below the first console.log, reassign the mySalary variable to a 150000.
      //   mySalary = 150000;
      //   console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my new salary is " + mySalary);
      //   // 6. In the script you created in step 4, create a Boolean variable named veteran and assign it to true or false depending on whether you are a veteran or not.
      //   let veteran = false;
      //   console.log("I am a veteran: " + veteran);

      //   // 7. In the script you created in step 4, add three console.log() statements to determine the data type of the myName, mySalary, and veteran variables.
      //   console.log("Data type of myName variable is: " + typeof myName);
      //   console.log("Data type of mySalary variable is: " + typeof mySalary);
      //   console.log("Data type of veteran variable is: " + typeof veteran);

      //   // 8. Console.log each of these expressions to the console:
      //   console.log("" + 1 + 0);
      //   console.log("" - 1 + 0);
      //   console.log(true + false);
      //   console.log(6 / "3");
      //   console.log("2" * "3");
      //   console.log(4 + 5 + "px");
      //   console.log("$" + 4 + 5);
      //   console.log("4" - 2);
      //   console.log("4px" - 2);
      //   console.log(7 / 0);
      //   console.log("  -9  " + 5);
      //   console.log("  -9  " - 5);
      //   console.log(null + 1);
      //   console.log(undefined + 1);
      //   // 9.In two different statements after these variable declarations, console.log the value of x and y.
      //   // x is assigned to the number 5
      //   let x = 5;
      //   console.log(`x is equal to: ${x}`);
      //   // ---------------
      //   // y is assigned to 1 plus the initial value of x multiplied by 2 resulting in 11
      //   let y = 1 + (x *= 2);
      //   console.log(`y is equal to: ${y}`);
      //   console.log(`New x is equal to: ${x}`);
      //   // After being reassinged x is equal to 10
      // let number1 = "10";

      // let number2 = "2";

      // let number3 = number1 * number2;
      // console.log(typeof number3);
      // alert(5 + 10 * 2);
      // let students = "15";

      // let candyBars = "30";

      // let candyBarsPerStudent = candyBars + students;

      // alert(candyBarsPerStudent); // yields...
      // // alert("18" / 2 + 4); // yields....
      // let students = "15";

      // let candyBars = "30";

      // let candyBarsPerStudent = +candyBars + students;

      // alert(candyBarsPerStudent); // yields...
      // let counter = 2;

      // alert(++counter); //yields...
      // alert(+"false"); //  yields...
      // let a = 3,
      //   b = 4,
      //   c = 5;

      // alert(c); // yields...
      // let students = "15";

      // let candyBars = "30";

      // let candyBarsPerStudent = +candyBars + +students;

      // alert(candyBarsPerStudent); // yields...
      // let students = "15";

      // let candyBars = "30";

      // let candyBarsPerStudent = candyBars / students;

      // alert(candyBarsPerStudent);

      // // What appears in the alert?
      let n = 5;
      n = n + 2;
      n = n * 3;
      alert(n); // yields...
