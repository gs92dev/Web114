      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Identify a common JavaScript style guide, and hyperlink to it.<br />
          This repository on GitHub seems interesting:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide</a
          >
          and this one too:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/standard/standard"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Standard JS</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify three distinct "best practice" programming practices and
          explain how they create better code.<br />
          1- The use of ";" makes the code more readable and less error-prone.
          With that, it is easier to identify where the statement is
          finishing.<br />
          2-The use of const instead of var and let makes it easier to identify
          variables that should not be changed. In case another developer
          working on the same team, for example, tries to modify it, they will
          get an error.<br />
          3-Using version control systems like Git, it is possible to keep track
          of each change made in the code, even if the change is really small,
          like a comma . This way, it is possible to go back to a previous
          version if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify three distinct sloppy programming practices and explain the
          problems they each create.
        </li>
        <li>
          1-Explain the difference between a primitive, an array, and an object
          and include an example of each.<br />
          Too many comments ib the code, comments are good and should be used
          but if the code has too many comments that means the code is not
          self-explanatory and it is hard to understand.<br />
          2- Poor naming conventions, for variables, functions, classes, etc.
          The variables should have short, but descriptive names so when other
          developers look at the code they can understand what the variable is
          for.<br />
          3- Code without proper indentation, it is hard to read and understand
          and can make the code look really messy. A well indented code is
          easier to read and understand, and supports collaboration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain the phrase "Fractions divided by powers of 2 are exactly
          represented in the binary system" and what universal problem this is
          referring to in all programming languages. (You might want to view my
          YouTube on why 0.1 + 0.2 is not equal to 0.3). Another way to think
          about this is to ask yourself these questions -- can all decimal
          integers (the numbering system we use that uses values of 0-9) be
          accurately represented by the binary (the numbering system the
          computer uses with values of 0 and 1)? Can all decimal fractions be
          accurately represented by the binary numbering system? Which ones can?
          Which ones cannot?<br />
          Binary (base-2) accurately represents fractions divisible by powers of
          2 (e.g., 0.5, 0.25). This is because they can be expressed as sums of
          negative powers of 2. However, fractions like 0.1 cannot be
          represented exactly due to binary limitations. These often lead to
          repeating binary patterns.

      // 1. Create a function declaration that prompts the visitor to enter two numbers and an operator (+ - * /)

      // For example, entries of 3 5 and + would result in the expression, 3 + 5.
      // Console.log the result of the expression in the function.
      //  Run the function.  ** Do not use the eval() method in your function or ever.
      // It is considered a security hole given it runs the code without question which lends itself to injection attacks.
      // Errors created by the code running within an eval() method are also nightmares to debug. **

        let num1 = prompt("Enter the first number");
        let num2 = prompt("Enter the second number");

      // 2-Create a function expression with the variable name of cheery that uses Math.random() to randomly select and console.log a cheery message from an array of at least 5 cheery messages.

      const cheery = function () {
        const messages = [

      // function that accepts a string as a argument and returns the string with the first letter capitalized.
      function ucFirst(str) {

      }

      alert(ucFirst("john")); //Alert the result (John) of the function with the string "john" as argument.

      //4.  Copy the code for the checkSpam function in the String lesson and add an explanatory comment to the end of each line.

      //Function that accepts a string as an argument and returns true if the string contains the words "viagra" or "xxx" and false otherwise.
      function checkSpam(str) {
        let lowerStr = str.toLowerCase(); // Convert the string to lowercase and store it in the lowerStr variable.

        return lowerStr.includes("viagra") || lowerStr.includes("xxx"); // Return true if the string contains the words "viagra" or "xxx" and false otherwise.
      }

      alert(checkSpam("buy ViAgRA now")); //call the function with the string "buy ViAgRA now" as argument. true.
      alert(checkSpam("free xxxxx")); //call the function with the string "free xxxxx" as argument. true.
      alert(checkSpam("innocent rabbit")); //call the function with the string "innocent rabbit" as argument. false.

      //5. Copy the code for the truncate function in the String lesson and add an explanatory comment to the end of each line.

      //Function that accepts a string and a number as arguments and returns the string truncated to the specified length.
      function truncate(str, maxlength) {
        return str.length > maxlength ? str.slice(0, maxlength - 1) + "…" : str; //Return the string truncated to the specified length if the string is longer than the specified length, otherwise return the string.

      // 6.  Modify the Sum input numbers exercise in the Array lesson to average the values vs. sum them.
      // Add code to constrain the acceptable values between 0 and 100. Modify the prompt to clarify this limitation as well.
      // Name the function averageInput.  Use a function declaration.

      function averageInput() {
        let numbers = [];

        while (true) {
          let value = prompt(
            "Enter a number between 0 and 100, or cancel to finish:",
            0
          );

          if (value === "" || value === null || !isFinite(value)) {
            break;
          }

          value = Number(value);

          // Check if the value is within the acceptable range
          if (value >= 0 && value <= 100) {
            numbers.push(value);

        return average;
      }

      alert(averageInput());

      // 7.  Modify the maximal subarray in the Array lesson to add the two largest numbers in the array with one argument named arr.
      // Name the function addTwo using a function expression.  Also declare two arrays:

      let arr1 = [0, 1, 2, 5];
      let arr2 = [10, 20, 4, 1];

      const addTwo = function (arr) {
        // Sort the array in descending order and take the first two elements
        let sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => b - a);
        let largest = sortedArr[0]; // Get the largest number
        let secondLargest = sortedArr[1]; // Get the second largest number

        return largest + secondLargest;
      };

      alert(addTwo(arr1)); // alert 7 (5 + 2)
      alert(addTwo(arr2)); // alert 30 (20 + 10)

      // 8.  Rewrite the sortByAge function in the Array methods lesson using traditional function syntax vs. arrow syntax.
      //  (This example uses the sort() function, a "higher order" callback function in that it is "called back" against every item in the array.
      //  Big concept!!!  We get deeper into callback functions in WEB 124, JavaScript II).
      function sortByAge(arr) {
        //traditional function syntax instead of arrow syntax
        arr.sort(function (a, b) {
          return a.age - b.age;
        });
      }

      let john = { name: "John", age: 25 };
      let pete = { name: "Pete", age: 30 };
      let mary = { name: "Mary", age: 28 };

      let arr = [pete, john, mary];

      sortByAge(arr);

      // now sorted is: [john, mary, pete]
      alert(arr[0].name); // John
      alert(arr[1].name); // Mary
      alert(arr[2].name); // Pete

      let btnText = darkBtn.textContent; // Get the text content of the button element and store it in the btnText variable.
      // Function to change the color of the page to dark mode.
      const darkMode = (e) => {
        document.body.classList.toggle("dark"); // Toggle the dark class on the body element to change the color of the page.
        darkBtn.classList.toggle("buttonLight"); // Toggle the buttonLight class on the button element to change its color.
