      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the end of the Browser environment lesson, the author makes this
          comment "Now we'll get down to learning DOM, because the document
          plays the central role in the UI." Explain this sentence to a
          non-technical person. What is the DOM and how is it created? What is
          the document? What is the UI? How does this relate to JavaScript?<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          What specification documents does the author recommend (include the
          link and the description of the specification in your answer.)<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Nodes are not super important to worry about at this point in your
          JavaScript career other than to be aware of them. I really try to
          break down and prioritize the important things you need to know in
          each javascript.info lesson in my YouTubes. So let's review some basic
          JavaScript terminology as it relates to its connection with a web
          page.<br />
        </li>

        <li>
          What is the document? Choose from the following -- object, method,
          property<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          What operator do you use to access the methods and properties of an
          object?<br />
        </li>
        <li>What characters always follow a method?<br /></li>
        <li>What, in general, does a method of an object do?<br /></li>
        <li>What, in general, does a property of an object do?<br /></li>
      </ol>

    <script>
      for (let i = 0; i < document.body.childNodes.length; i++) {
        // add comment here
        console.log(document.body.childNodes[i]); // add comment here
      }
      for (let node of document.body.childNodes) {
        // add comment here
        console.log(node); // add comment here
      }

      //       2.  Use document.body as the starting point, then insert 12 console.log statements into your script to demonstrate the navigation properties found in the Summary section of the Walking the DOM lesson.

      // For all nodes: parentNode, childNodes, firstChild, lastChild, previousSibling, nextSibling.
      // For element nodes only: parentElement, children, firstElementChild, lastElementChild, previousElementSibling, nextElementSibling.
      // e.g.  console.log(document.body.parentNode);
    </script>
