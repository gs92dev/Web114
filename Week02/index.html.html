      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the end of the Browser environment lesson, the author makes this
          comment "Now we'll get down to learning DOM, because the document
          plays the central role in the UI." Explain this sentence to a
          non-technical person. What is the DOM and how is it created? What is
          the document? What is the UI? How does this relate to JavaScript?<br /><br />
          The DOM is the Document Object Model, which is a programming interface
          created by the browsers (like Chrome or Safari), the DOM is like a map
          structure that represents the elements of a web page. The document is
          the root of the DOM tree, like a tree structure, the document is the
          1st, main branch and all the other elements are like branches of this
          main one. The UI is the "User Interface" which is the visual part of
          the web page that the user interacts with. With JavaScript, we can
          see, manipulate, and change all the elements of the web page, like
          changing the color of a button, or adding a new element to the page,
          and this is possible because of the DOM, which is the bridge between
          the web page and the JavaScript code.<br />

        <li>
          What specification documents does the author recommend (include the
          link and the description of the specification in your answer.)<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the document? Choose from the following -- object, method,
          property<br />Object
        </li>
        <li>
          What operator do you use to access the methods and properties of an
          object?<br />
          To access the methods and properties of an object we use the dot
          operator (.), so if we have an object called "House" with a key called
          "door" we can call this using House.door<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          What characters always follow a method?<br />
          Always a method we use (), some methods allows us to use arguments
          when we call it like method(something).
        </li>
        <li>
          What, in general, does a method of an object do?<br />
          It's common for methods of objects to make some kind of action,
          because of that, usually, when we name methods we give a verb as the
          name, like "run" or "greet".
        </li>
        <li>
          What, in general, does a property of an object do?<br />Usually, a
          object property store some kind of data that is related to the object,
          so if we have an object called "Person", we could give it properties
          like: "age", "name", "address" etc.

      console.log(document.body.parentNode); //The console display the html element with all the nodes.
      //Child Nodes
      console.log(document.body.childNodes); //The console display all the nodes inside the body element on my case with length 10.

      //Last Child
      console.log(document.body.lastChild); //The console display the last node inside the body element being a script element.
      //Previous Sibling
      console.log(document.body.previousSibling); //The console display the previous sibling of the body element being a text (empty text).
      //Next Sibling
      console.log(document.body.nextSibling); //The console display the next sibling of the body element being null since there is no next sibling after body.

      // // For element nodes only: parentElement, children, firstElementChild, lastElementChild, previousElementSibling, nextElementSibling.
      //Parent Element
      console.log(document.body.parentElement); //The console display the html element with all the nodes.
      //Children
      console.log(document.body.children); //The console display all the nodes inside the body element on my case with length 3.
      //First Element Child
      console.log(document.body.firstElementChild); //The console display the first node inside the body element being a header element.
      //Last Element Child
      console.log(document.body.lastElementChild); //The console display the last node inside the body element being a script element.
      //Previous Element Sibling
      console.log(document.body.previousElementSibling); //The console display the previous sibling of the body element being a head element.
      //Next Element Sibling
      console.log(document.body.nextElementSibling); //The console display the next sibling of the body element being null since there is no next sibling after body.
      //With that is possible to see the navigation properties of the body element. The first 6 console.log are for all nodes and the last 6 are for element(tags) nodes only.
