      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the end of the Browser environment lesson, the author makes this
          comment "Now we'll get down to learning DOM, because the document
          plays the central role in the UI." Explain this sentence to a
          non-technical person. What is the DOM and how is it created? What is
          the document? What is the UI? How does this relate to JavaScript?<br /><br />
          The DOM is the Document Object Model, which is a programming interface
          created by the browsers (like Chrome or Safari), the DOM is like a map
          structure that represents the elements of a web page. The document is
          the root of the DOM tree, like a tree structure, the document is the
          1st, main branch and all the other elements are like branches of this
          main one. The UI is the "User Interface" which is the visual part of
          the web page that the user interacts with. With JavaScript, we can
          see, manipulate, and change all the elements of the web page, like
          changing the color of a button, or adding a new element to the page,
          and this is possible because of the DOM, which is the bridge between
          the web page and the JavaScript code.<br />

          What specification documents does the author recommend (include the
          link and the description of the specification in your answer.)<br />
          <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">DOM Living Standard</a><br />
          -- This is the specification for the Document Object Model (DOM) and
          it is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
          Group (WHATWG). The DOM Living Standard defines the structure and
          behavior of the DOM, which is used by web browsers to represent web
          pages as a tree of objects.<br />
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/"
            >W3C(CSS Object Model (CSSOM))</a
          ><br />
          -- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community
          that develops standards and guidelines to help people build a web base
          ont he principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and
          more. The CSS Object Model (CSSOM) specification defines how CSS
          styles are represented in the DOM and how they can be manipulated
          using JavaScrip<br />
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a><br />
          -- MDN Web Docs is a resource for web developers that provides
          detailed documentation on web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. It is maintained by the Mozilla Foundation and is widely
          regarded as a reliable and up-to-date source of information for web
          developers.<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the document? Choose from the following -- object, method,
          property<br />Object
        </li>
        <li>
          What operator do you use to access the methods and properties of an
          object?<br />
          To access the methods and properties of an object we use the dot
          operator (.), so if we have an object called "House" with a key called
          "door" we can call this using House.door<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          What characters always follow a method?<br />
          Always a method we use (), some methods allows us to use arguments
          when we call it like method(something).
        </li>
        <li>
          What, in general, does a method of an object do?<br />
          It's common for methods of objects to make some kind of action,
          because of that, usually, when we name methods we give a verb as the
          name, like "run" or "greet".
        </li>
        <li>
          What, in general, does a property of an object do?<br />Usually, a
          object property store some kind of data that is related to the object,
          so if we have an object called "Person", we could give it properties
          like: "age", "name", "address" etc.

      //Last Element Child

      //Previous Element Sibling

      //Next Element Sibling
      console.log(document.body.nextElementSibling); //The console display the next sibling of the body element being null since there is no next sibling after body.
      //With that is possible to see the navigation properties of the body element. The first 6 console.log are for all nodes and the last 6 are for element(tags) nodes only.
